# ProotLinuxInstallFast
Scripts for fast installing linux distros though Proot-Distro but with single command(start,reset,remove,install)
Hey! Maybe thats funny i created these scripts but some people don't know about isolated mode, it disabled mount of your phone rootfs and makes distro secure and killable(you can kill it)!
These distros are running in isolated mode ONLY, if you want disable it:
1. Type "nano start-<distro>.sh"
2. Scroll down for "proot-distro login ALIAS --isolated"
3. Remove --isolated
4. Done! Now you can access phone storage but it's not recomended to enable it if you don't want have problems, better use our scripts.

Unoffical distros is folder where i post my and users scripts about unoffical distros, USE ISOLATED MODE, MAYBE NEEDED HIGH-END PHONE!!1
